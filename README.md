Author: Yashovardhan Singh Project Type: Descriptive Analytics — HR Domain Tool Stack: Python · Streamlit · Pandas · Plotly

📌 Project Description

A complete, end-to-end Descriptive Analytics project built on an HR Employee dataset of 14,999 records across 10 departments. The project follows the full analytics workflow:

Data Understanding → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → KPI Calculation → Descriptive Analytics → Visualization → Insights

The result is a professional, interactive Streamlit dashboard with:

📊 6 KPI Cards (Attrition Rate, Satisfaction, Hours, Tenure, Promotions) 🔍 5 Interactive Sidebar Filters (Department, Salary, Status, Satisfaction, Tenure) 📉 Attrition Analysis (donut, grouped bar, scatter, horizontal bar) 🏢 Department Analysis (radar chart, summary table, comparison bars) 💰 Salary Analysis (distribution, attrition by salary, satisfaction vs salary) 😊 Satisfaction & Workload (histogram, boxplot, heatmap, workload classification) 📈 Experience & Promotion (tenure trends, promotion impact, dual-axis project chart) 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations (dynamic, data-driven priority matrix)

📊 Analytics Workflow

Data Understanding
14,999 employee records, 11 features Mix of percentage strings, binary flags, ordinal text, and numeric columns Target variable: left (binary attrition flag)

Data Cleaning
Strip whitespace from column names and string values Convert percentage strings ("38%") to floats (0.38) Explicit type casting with pd.to_numeric() + error coercion Remove duplicates with drop_duplicates() Impute missing values: median for numeric, mode for categorical

Data Transformation
Feature Transformation salary Ordinal encoding: low=1, medium=2, high=3 left Label: "Left" / "Stayed" satisfaction_level Binned: Low / Medium / High time_spend_company Grouped: Junior / Mid / Senior / Veteran average_montly_hours Categorised: Normal / High / Overloaded Department Title-case standardisation promotion_last_5years Label: "Promoted" / "Not Promoted"

KPI Calculation
KPI Full-Dataset Value Total Employees 14,999 Attrition Rate 23.8% Avg Satisfaction 61.3% Avg Monthly Hours 201 h Avg Tenure 3.5 years Promotion Rate 2.1%

💡 Key Findings

High attrition — 23.8% vs ~15% industry benchmark Satisfaction is the strongest predictor — employees below 30% satisfaction leave at dramatically higher rates Salary gap — low-salary employees leave at 30%+ vs ~7% for high-salary Overwork drives burnout — overloaded employees (>220 h/month) are a major at-risk cohort Promotions halve attrition — promoted employees leave at far lower rates; only 2.1% were promoted Year-3 tenure spike — attrition peaks at the 3-year mark, a critical intervention window

🏢 HR Recommendations (Summary)

Priority Action

🔴 Critical review & retention bonuses for low-salary cohort 🔴 Critical Targeted engagement in highest-attrition department 🟠 High Structured career paths & transparent promotion criteria 🟠 High Workload caps & mental health support 🟡 Medium Stay interviews at 2–3 year tenure mark 🟡 Medium Improved onboarding & 6-month check-ins 🟢 Ongoing Quarterly employee pulse surveys
